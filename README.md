# Networks-Project (Maja & Diana)
# 1) run the API with the "Original Dataset.xls"
With the "Webscrapping.ipynb" API (human) in jupyter notebook we can construct 16 csv files with the information on the targets of our 16 proteins (we found on BioGrid).
# 2) run the code with the library
The code is written in the "Final code -phytomedicine project.ipynb pythomedicine" jupyter notebook, and
the library of additional functions  for the code can be found in Networks_functions. 
# 3) data for the knowledge graph of the degree trimmed network
The code uses the information on tagging the degree trimmed network that can be found in "functions_data.xls". 
# 4) knowledge expansion
The code uses  additional features that can be found in "Finalised-knowledge-graph (3).xlsx" for the knowledge expansion.
Results were exported, and can be found in "Features.xlsx".
